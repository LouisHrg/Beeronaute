## About Beeronaute

Beeronaute is a 3rd year student project for Laravel Course. The objective was to use as many features than possible. 
The main purpose of the project is just to have fun and discover new places to go to hangouts. It's a Social Network where Bars Manager can register their bars and pubs and organise events.
